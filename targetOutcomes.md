## Article ID: EXT_24-4-2015

For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section of Study 1.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Pretest performance did not differ as a function of group, as revealed by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), F(1, 42) = 0.01, p > .250 (see Fig. 2, left panel). However, an ANOVA controlling for pretest accuracy revealed that group did have a significant effect on posttest
performance, F(1, 41) = 5.21, p = .028, ηp 2 = .113. Students in the action group showed a significantly nonzero (~10%) gain in accuracy from pretest to posttest, t(21) = 3.07, p = .006. Those in the observation group did not, t(21) = –0.01, p > .250 (see Fig. 2, left panel).

Note that footnote 1 may also be relevant.
